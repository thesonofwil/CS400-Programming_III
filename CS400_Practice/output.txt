I rate movies. Feed me a file to hear the truth.
I left you a file with my wise insights.
Any other movies you want to hear my opinion on? Type "Quit" to exit. 
Boss Baby
Boss Baby - I wish I had gouged my eyes out
Despicable Me
Despicable Me - The director should never have been born
Inside Out
Inside Out - Would be good if Danny Devito were in it
The Ring
The Ring - Not even Jesus can save this sin of a movie
Quit
I hope you learned something new today.
