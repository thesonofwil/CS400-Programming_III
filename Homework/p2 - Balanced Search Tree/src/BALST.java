     * example: numbers 10-99, or strings aa - zz, or AA to ZZ
     *
     * This makes it easier for you to not worry about spacing issues.
     *
     * You can display a binary search in any of a variety of ways, 
     * but we must see a tree that we can identify left and right children 
     * of each node
     *
     * For example: 
     
           30
           /\
          /  \
         20  40
         /   /\
        /   /  \
       10  35  50 

       Look from bottom to top. Inorder traversal of above tree (10,20,30,35,40,50)
       
       Or, you can display a tree of this kind.

       |       |-------50
       |-------40
       |       |-------35
       30
       |-------20
       |       |-------10
       
       Or, you can come up with your own orientation pattern, like this.

       10                 
               20
                       30
       35                
               40
       50                  

       The connecting lines are not required if we can interpret your tree.
